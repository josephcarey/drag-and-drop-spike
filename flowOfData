Each contest has participants on the "person_contest" table:

id  person_id   contest_id  role
1   1           1           'lead'
2   2           1           'follow'



Once the competition is ready to go, we tell the server to randomly pair people.
It returns "couple" entries:

id      contest_id      lead_id     follow_id
1       1               1           2
2       1               3           4

Each judge gets all of the pairings for that contest, submits their whole array,
and the server translates it into score objects:

id      judge_id        couple_id       placement
1       7               1               2

Then at some point, the head judge tells the server to process the score
(or it automatically does so when the last judge submits their scores).
